#' Shadow Test item selection
#'
#' Based on the Shadow Testing adaptive test assembly procedure by van der Linden (XXX)
#'
#' At each step in a CAT, a Shadow Test is created consisting of an optimal complete test meeting all constraints.
#' The best item that was not already administrated is then selected from this test, and presented to the respondent.
#'
#' @param number_items number of items in the test bank
#' @param administered vector with indeces of administered items
#' @param available vector with indeces of yet available items
#' @param responses vector with person responses
#' @param lp_constraints data frame with constraints in lp format: the lp_constraints from the list returned by constraints_lp_format()
#' @param lp_characters data frame with characteristics in lp format: the lp_chars from the list returned by constraints_lp_format()
#' @param item_information vector with summarized information of each yet available item, with zeros for administered items (returned by get_summarized_information() with pad = TRUE)
#' @return integer item index of item with maximum information within constraints
