\usage{
test_must_stop(number_responses, estimate, min_n, max_n,
  stop_variance_target = NULL, cutoffs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{number_responses}{number of responses given}

\item{estimate}{vector with current theta estimate, with covariance matrix as its attribute}

\item{min_n}{minimum test length; NULL means no minimum test length}

\item{max_n}{test length at which testing should stop (even if target has not been reached yet in case of variance stopping rule)}

\item{stop_variance_target}{a vector with the variance target for each dimension; if null, variance is not taken into account}

\item{cutoffs}{matrix containing cut off values per dimension (columns) and test iteration (rows). First row contains cut off values for when no items have been
administered yet, second row for when one item has been administered, etc. If estimate + 3SE < cutoff for each dimension at certain iteration, test stops; NULL means no cut off values}
}
\value{
TRUE if test should stop, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
Control function to check if the test is completed.
